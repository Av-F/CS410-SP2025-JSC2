                                                                         Glossary:

                                                                        Materials:
In order to run the project, you will need these items:
* 1 Type C USB cable
* 4 Buttons
* 1 ESP-32
* 1 Joystick module 
* Arduino

                                                                         Steps:
1) Build the controller by plugging in the ESP-32 module and using male to male pins plug in the x axis pin to ESP-32's D35, Y axis to D26,
A button to the bread board's 13, B button to 14, Start button to 15 and select to 12. You can reach these areas with resistors and other cables, 
also ensure that the joystick grnd is  plugged into the ESP-32 GRND and joystick V goes to VIN. 
2) Download Arduino and in the Arduino library, install the BLE gamepad library
3) Use the prototype_V1.ino program with your controller as all of the button pins are mapped accordingly
4) Ensure that the Arduino can read the ESP-32 when plugged into the type C cable (the ESP should have a light glowing red).
5) Hit the upload button for the code to be transmitted to the ESP 32
6) Once the code has successfully ran, go to where you'd like to use the controller's Bluetooth settings and find "The Better Controller" and hit accept.    

                                                                          MISC
If you're on PC, you must have a steam account where in the account, you must go to Big Picture Mode and condifure the controller there.
You can use the controller on your phone and in on apps where controller configuration is avaliable and on PC using Steam's big picture mode
